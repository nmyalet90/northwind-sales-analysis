# 📊 Northwind Sales Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## 🧭 Introduction – Database Context

This project is based on the **Northwind sample database**, a classic relational database that represents the operations of a fictional trading company. Northwind stores information about:

- Customers and their locations
- Orders and order details
- Products and product categories
- Employees and sales representatives
- Suppliers and shippers

The database is widely used for learning and demonstrating **data modeling, SQL querying, and business intelligence concepts**, as it closely resembles real-world transactional systems. In this project, Northwind is used as the data source to perform a complete sales analysis, from raw SQL tables to a business-oriented Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an **end-to-end analytical solution**, combining:

- **SQL Server** for data extraction, transformation, and validation
- **Power BI** for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualization

This approach reflects a realistic analytics workflow, where raw transactional data is first prepared using SQL and then consumed by a BI tool to support decision-making.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

To run and explore this dashboard, you will need:

- **Microsoft SQL Server** (Express or higher)
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Power BI Desktop**

---

## ▶️ How to Use the Dashboard

1. Restore Northwind database backup file (`northwind.bak`) in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
2. Open the `.pbix` file using **Power BI Desktop**
3. Connect to the Northwind database
4. In the Power BI dashboard, use the available slicers to filter data by:
   - Date
   - Product category
   - Country
   - Employee (sales representative)
5. Explore KPIs, charts, and tables to gain insights into sales and logistics performance

## 🗂️ SQL Database Diagram

The following diagram represents the original **Northwind SQL database schema**, showing all tables and their relationships:

This schema highlights the transactional nature of the database, with `Orders` and `Order Details` at the core, connected to dimensions such as Customers, Products, Employees, Shippers, and Categories.

## 🔄 SQL Queries & Power BI Data Model

To prepare the data for analysis, several SQL queries were created and imported into Power BI. These queries transform the normalized transactional tables into an **analytical star schema**, consisting of:

### Fact Table
- **fact_sales**
  - One row per order line
  - Includes sales amount, quantity, discount, unit price
  - Connected to all dimension tables

### Dimension Tables
- **dim_products** – product and category information
- **dim_customers** – customer and geographic data
- **dim_employees** – sales representatives
- **dim_shippers** – shipping companies
- **dim_date** – calendar table created to enable time intelligence

The resulting Power BI data model and relationships are shown below:

This model follows best practices for BI projects, enabling efficient filtering, accurate aggregations, and flexible analysis.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview

The final Power BI dashboard provides a consolidated view of sales performance, trends, and contribution analysis:

The dashboard includes interactive slicers for **year, month, and product category**, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.

## 📈 Dashboard Visual Analysis

### 1️⃣ Sales by Employee

This chart shows total sales generated by each employee:

- Identifies top-performing sales representatives
- Reveals differences in individual contribution
- Useful for performance evaluation and incentive analysis

A small number of employees generate a large portion of total sales, which is typical in sales-driven organizations.

---

### 2️⃣ Sales by Country

This visualization displays total sales by customer country:

- Highlights the most important geographic markets
- Shows revenue concentration by region
- Helps identify opportunities for market expansion

Countries such as **USA and Germany** stand out as major contributors to total revenue.

---

### 3️⃣ Sales by Date

This time-series chart represents sales evolution over time:

- Shows overall growth trends
- Reveals seasonality and short-term fluctuations
- Useful for forecasting and demand planning

The upward trend indicates sustained growth, with visible monthly variations.

---

### 4️⃣ Cumulative Sales by Category (Pareto Analysis)

This Pareto chart combines:

- Bars: sales by product category
- Line: cumulative percentage of total sales

Key insight:
- A small subset of categories (around 20–30%) accounts for roughly **80% of total sales**

This analysis supports the **Pareto principle (80/20 rule)** and helps prioritize high-impact product categories.

---

## 📌 KPI Analysis

### 🔹 Total Sales

Represents the total revenue generated in the selected period:

- Core indicator of business performance
- Sensitive to filters (date, category, country)

---

### 🔹 Average Order Value (AOV)

Calculated as:

> Total Sales / Total Orders

Insights:
- Measures customer purchase behavior
- Helps evaluate pricing and upselling strategies

---

### 🔹 Total Orders

Counts the number of distinct orders:

- Indicates sales volume and activity level
- Complements Total Sales and AOV for a complete picture

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete **data analytics workflow**, from a relational SQL database to an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Key takeaways:

- SQL is essential for understanding and preparing structured data
- A star-schema model improves analytical performance and clarity
- Power BI enables fast, interactive, and business-focused insights
- Sales are highly concentrated by employee, country, and product category
